### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jakub and I'm a software engineer based in Czechia.

- Working mostly with Node.js, Nest.js and TypeScript on BE
- And React or Angular with TypeScript on FE
- I'm also a big fan of functional programming 
- I currently learn Rust to expand my knowledge to systems programming
- And I feel like WASM is gonna be a big one, so I want to be prepared
